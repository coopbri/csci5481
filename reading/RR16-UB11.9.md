  <h1>Reading Response | UB Ch. 11.9</h1>
</center>

### Key points (1-3 sentences)
Section 11.9 covered nucleotides tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA and introduced them as "long chains of nucleotides that fold into various secondary structures". The key idea of the section is a biophysical one: an RNA secondary structure (based on such nucleotides) can be determined by free energy during the formation of base pairs. Essentially, higher free energy is coupled with more work, so it is less likely that that structure would be formed (and similar the other way around: less energy = less work, so a higher chance that the structure would be formed).

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
The reading terminated with extended reading ("Further Reading") about RNA prediction methods based on context-free grammars, but didn't offer a glimpse into what such methods are. Despite extending the reader into the "Further Reading", I think it would be beneficial to at least offer an idea of what the methods entail.

### Question(s)
During secondary structure analysis, are tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA considered somewhat equally or do they have varying weights in terms of usefulness (even if it's situational/context-based)?
