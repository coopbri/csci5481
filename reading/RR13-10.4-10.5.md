  <h1>Reading Response | UB Ch. 10.4 - 10.5</h1>
</center>

### Key points (1-3 sentences)
Sections 10.4 and 10.5 covered somewhat similar material to the previous two sections (10.2 and 10.3), although for eukaryotes instead of prokaryotes. 10.4 expanded gene detection features and carefully examined the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes, elaborating on the relative difficulty of eukaryotic gene detection (due to intron/exon length differences compared to prokaryotes and lower gene density). 10.5 focused on gene signals and described accuracy improvements by core promoter identification and overall sequence properties.

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
Methods for eukaryotic gene prediction (such as GenScan and NNPP) were introduced, but they weren't supplemented with as many diagrams or mathematics as the previous (prokaryotic) sections in chapter 10. The reading could benefit from augmenting these things.

### Question(s)
I have no questions on this reading.
