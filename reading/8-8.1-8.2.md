### Key points (1-3 sentences)
These sections discussed evolutionary models and measures of evolutionary distance (8.1) and single phylogenetic tree generation methods (8.2), both of which serve as part of the foundation for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from alignment data. The distance measures discussed range from relatively simple (p-distance) to relatively complex (d_K2P, as part of Kimura two-parameter model), along with their practicality in use. The phylogenetic tree generation methods discussed (such as clustering methods and Fitch-Margoliash method) involve a heavy aura of "no free lunch", with quick points about the advantages and disadvantages of each.
