  <h1>Reading Response | Assembly of ... Repeat Graphs</h1>

### Key points (1-3 sentences)
This article introduced the Flye algorithm for genome assembly and compared it to several "state-of-the art" assemblers: Canu, Falcon, HINGE, Miniasm, and MaSuRCA. Flye generates a repeat graph to store information about repeating segments in a genome for unbridged repeats (repeats are "bridged" if 1+ read(s) contains one of its copies). Flye was shown to assemble a larger amount of the human genome than Canu and MaSuRCA, assemble more accurately than HINGE on complex eukaryotes (YEAST and WORM were tested),  was faster than Falcon on assembling the WORM dataset, and had a higher sequence identity than Miniasm.

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
The reading appears to hastily end with saying that there is potential room for growth in research for assembly algorithms that handle unbridged repeats. I think some more direction in this regard would augment the reading well.
