### Key points (1-3 sentences)
These two sections (10.2 and 10.3) covered gene detection of prokaryotic entities and described the structure of open reference frames (ORFs) for gene reading (10.2) and various algorithmic approaches (10.3). As far as the algorithmic approaches, GeneMark and GLIMMER were discussed (both of which use a Markov model variants), as well as ORPHEUS (sequence homology), GeneMark.hmm (HMMs), and EcoParse (HMMs).

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
Perhaps this is due to my lack of a biological background, but I don't think the reading went into enough biological depth in chapter 10.2. I would have loved to seen more elaboration on concepts such as hexanucleotices/dicodons and why they are useful for gene prediction.

### Question(s)
Following from my previous point, what is the advantage of hexanucleotide analysis versus individual codon analysis for certain sequences?
