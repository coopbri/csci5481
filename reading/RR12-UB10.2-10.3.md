### Key points (1-3 sentences)
These two sections (10.2 and 10.3) covered gene detection of prokaryotic entities and described the structure of open reference frames (ORFs) for gene reading (10.2) and various algorithmic approaches (10.3). As far as the algorithmic approaches, GeneMark and GLIMMER were discussed (both of which use a Markov model variants), as well as ORPHEUS (sequence homology), GeneMark.hmm (HMMs), and EcoParse (HMMs).
