### Key points (1-3 sentences)
This article introduces a classification algorithm called the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, which is a Naive Bayes classifier for solving ML classification problems. The RDP Classifier matches sequences derived from bacterial and archaeal (16S ribosomal RNA) genes and fungal (28S ribosomal RNA) genes to a taxonomy model.

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
It was cool to see so much machine learning content in this paper (naturally), though without background in previous machine learning classes I think the content would have been significantly more confusing. Thus, I think (despite being a domain-specific academic paper) the paper would benefit from further explaining classifiers (kNN/Bayesian), features, etc.
