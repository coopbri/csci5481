### Key points (1-3 sentences)
This article introduces a classification algorithm called the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, which is a Naive Bayes classifier for solving ML classification problems. The RDP Classifier matches sequences derived from bacterial and archaeal (16S ribosomal RNA) genes to a taxonomy model. The Ribosomal Database Project has been using this classifier for several years (as of 2007) to continually improve and tune their model.

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
It was cool to see so much machine learning content in this paper (naturally), though without background in previous machine learning classes I think the content would have been significantly more confusing for me. Thus, I think (despite being a domain-specific academic paper) the paper would benefit from slightly further expanding upon classifiers (kNN/Bayesian), features, etc.

### Question(s)
The training set is limited to rather specific genetic data. Could this algorithm expand well to vastly different sequence categories?
