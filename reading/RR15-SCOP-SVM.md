### Key points (1-3 sentences)
The authors of this article introduce a SVM algorithm with a custom, novel kernel function and explain its usage for protein classification in reference to the SCOP database. Using the rate of false positives (RFP) as a metric, it was shown to have extremely low error rates compared to other methods on certain protein families. The experiments were done on retro-padded sequences (with appended randomly-generated amino acids).

### Added to reading (1-2 sentences)
The authors mention that this particular kernel method may have other uses in biosequence analysis, but hardly mention concrete suggestions for other uses (aside from small bits such as suggesting future research on experiments without artificially padded sequences). The reading could benefit from filling this gap.

### Question(s)
RFP was used to measure model accuracy. Would other performance metrics produce similar relative results?
