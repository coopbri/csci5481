#### Question 4 Answers

1. Of the original input query sequences, approximately __98.998%__ had a match in the reference database at 97% or above.
2. The most common (determinate) bacterial species in the query set is _Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_.
3. The average percent similarity of the matches among those above 97% is approximately __98.48%__.
